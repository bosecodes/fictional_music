### Generating all new music from old Irish folk songs

I use an LSTM based Recurrent Neural Network to create and train a model that takes in input, a bunch of Irish Folk songs, and trains on them to predict what sort of note/notes in the ABC notation can be possible after it. This helps the Neural Net to recognize patterns and learn to create music all by itself.

_AI for Music Production. Sounds promising._

_Well, guess what?_
#### It's really happening now...

Hyperparameters are optimized to my liking, feel free to test your own.

Inspiration for this project was from MIT 6.191 Course on Introduction to Machine Learning by Alexander Amini. Using RNNs for generic tasks other than sentiment analysis, and weather prediction and basic Natural Language Processing projects are all becoming common as ever, this one thing is what I think is still lacking. Although wtih GANs, I know the popularity of using such basic RNN based models will definitely decrease, this is an attempt to revive the broken soldier (lol!!!)
